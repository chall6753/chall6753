# Hi I am Charlie 

## I have recently started my transition as a Petroleum Engineer of 10 years to a software engineer. In May of this year I completed the software engineering bootcamp at Flatiron School and I'm currently on the job hunt. I am really excited to start down this new career path and can't wait to see what I will be building, creating and learning. 

### I am interested in building IOT projects such as an automated hydroponics garden which combines my passion for gardening with automation. It has been very exciting starting from nothing to eating more salads than I ever have before ðŸ˜„!! 

### This is a new and exciting journey for me and I look forward to working with great people and being challenged every step of the way.
